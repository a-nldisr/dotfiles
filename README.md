# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My dotfiles are my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my dotfiles are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless. I must fire my dotfiles true.

## How to use

```bash
make
```

## What Macbook type?

These dotfiles started on an Intel Macbook Pro, but now I have a M1 Pro.
Tried to seperate the setups, perhaps some parts will fail on Intel over time.
Your Mileage may vary.
